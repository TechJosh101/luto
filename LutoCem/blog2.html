  <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>Lutowiska municipality is located in the South-East part of Podkarpackie voivodeship, in the Bieszczady district. It lies near the border, a neighbour to both Ukraine and Slovakia. Within its limits are the highest peaks of the Bieszczady mountains and the picturesque valley of the river San, which takes it beginnings here. Half of the area of the municipality is under the strict environmental protection under the Bieszczady National Park. The unique features of the landscape and wildlife are the reasons why Lutowiska is a touristic area, appreciated by growing number of visitors every year.</p>
  <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p class="quote">Lutowiska municipality is a paradise for those who love hiking. Well marked trails and educational paths lead throughout the most important mountain ranges and peaks, such as Wetlińska Pasture, Caryńska Pasture, Bukowe Berdo, Szeroki Wierch or Tarnica, and their total length equals as much as 107 km. For those who prefer to spend their free time on two wheels, there is 106 km of cycling routes waiting here. Our region is also a fantastic place for those who love horse riding and would like to enjoy the Bieszczady landscapes from the saddle. There are several stables and horse riding centres (including those with Hutsul horses) waiting for visitors, along with 146 km of paths adapted for horse riding.</p>
        <p>A special feature of the municipality is a huge afforestation, reaching over 90% of its surface. The beautiful Carpathian forest is inhabited by many animal species, among which we can find a Carpathian deer, lynx, wildcat, wild boar, bison, wolf, and even a brown bear. Over the forests dominate the pastures – a unique accumulation of Alpine and subalpine grasslands, in Poland found only in Bieszczady. Countless riches of flora and fauna make everyone feel good here: whether you are a pursuer of the nature’s secrets or a simple nature enthusiasts, you will enjoy your time.</p>
        <p>Historical turmoil that took place in the past century on the territory of today’s Lutowiska municipality left a number of historical attractions. The most interesting historical monuments include Boyko Orthodox Church in Smolnik, dated 1971, the Orthodox church in Chmiel, built in 1906, the Catholic church of St. Stanislaus in Lutowiska, and least but not last – the Jewish cemetery in Lutowiska, with around 1000 tombstones. These monuments illustrate perfectly the multicultural character of this region, which for centuries was the hallmark of this land. Those more curious can follow the mysterious trail of the villages, which no longer exist in the present time. This gives the possibility of truly fascinating visualisation of the past life, as it once was.</p>

	<h2>Historical Timeline</h2>
        <p class="quote">The Lutowiska municipality in Bieszczady is the land of the Bieszczady pastures, clean mountain streams and forests, inhabited by bears, wolves and bison. It is the heart of one of the last true wilderness of Europe – the Polish “Wild East”.<br><br>
        The Lutowiska municipality is the southernmost and one of the largest in terms of its area (476 km2) in Poland. Inhabited by less than 2200 people it is one of the least populated regions of the country.</p>
        <p>It is the only Polish municipality that shares its boarders with both the Slovak Republic and Ukraine. It is the most attractive in Bieszczady mountains and the most affected during the displacement of the local population (1939-1947), and the struggles with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Over 80% of its area is plastered with forest, mainly Carpathian beech with addition of fir, sycamore and spruce.</p>
        <p>The area is fully covered by different forms of environmental legal protection. There are Easter Beskid Protected Landscape Area, San Valley Landscape National Park, Bieszczady National Park and numerous nature reserves, such as “Krywe”, guarding from extinction the last population of the Aesculapius serpent in Poland.</p>
        <p>The protected areas located in Lutowiska municipality have gained an international status: Bieszczady National Park and San Valley Landscape National Park are the foundations of the first European trilateral (Polish-Slovak-Ukrainian) UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve “Eastern Carpathians”, with a total area of 2132 km. Bieszczady National Park as the second national park in Poland was awarded the “European Dilpoma” in 1999 by the European Council for the most precious and best managed protected zone.</p>
        <p>Permanent settlement of the Ruthenian and Wallachian population in what is now the Lutowiska municipality began in the 15<sup>th</sup> century; however, most of the villages were founded in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. The foreign armies’ invasions, famine and epidemics in the 17<sup>th</sup> century resulted in a partial depopulation of the area. The 18<sup>th</sup> century was the period of re-populating of the abandoned villages, political stability, economic recovery and sustained development of the national and religious consciousness amongst the population, consisting of the Polish nobility, the Greek Catholic Ruthenians and Jews.</p>
        <p>After the abolition of serfdom in 1848 came the fragmentation of the land and the collapse of the estates without the free labour. The properties were auctioned and taken over by the wood merchants, who built the sawmills and narrow-gauge railway lines.</p>
        <p>In 1915, during heavy fights in the Carpathians, many villages were destroyed, and the local residents were plagued with epidemics and famine. In the 1920s the country’s reconstruction needs led to prosperity in the timber industry, so the new sawmills and factories were being founded, and oil exploration was carried out.</p>
        <p>The economic crisis in the 1930s led to the liquidation of many factories and the narrow-gauge railways. But the end of the decade brought another economic recovery, and the growth of tourism. Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement in 1939 the San river became a border that separated and divided the present-day municipality into areas occupied by German and Soviet armies. On the Soviet side 13 villages that existed in the so-called “border zone” were demolished and the people were displaced from their homes. Local intelligence class, government officials, priests and the forest service members were expelled to Siberia. On the left bank of the river San German soldiers began the repressions against the Jews, resulting in the extermination of Jewish people after the entire area was merged with the General Province in June 1941. At the same time, German forces fuelled the Polish-Ukrainian conflict. After concentration of the forces of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the terror against the Polish population intensified and continued during the invasion of the Soviet troops in September 1944; during the fighting many villages were torn to pieces.</p>
        <p>The new border along the San river between Poland and the Soviet Union divided the area of the present-day Lutowiska municipality once again. In the Soviet zone the forced collectivization of the villages and the introduction of the Orthodox church began; those who opposed were deported to Siberia. The name Lutowiska was changed to Szewczenkowo.</p>
        <p>On the Polish side the mountain regions up to the village Cisna were controlled by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. As early as 1944 under the “repatriation” began the deportation of the Ukrainian people to the Soviet Union (from 1946 it became compulsory). As part of the “Vistula” operation in 1947 the next phase of deportation took place; this led to the complete abandonment of the region. All buildings were destroyed and the vast areas of old villages were reclaimed by nature. After so-called “borders equalizing” in 1951, caused by the discovery of the coal deposits in the sokalski district, Lutowiska were returned to Poland and the previous residents from Sokalszczyzna came back. Repopulation began in Bieszczady, but despite this, from 28 villages existing before the war, only 17 is now inhabited, and the population decreased tenfold (from 21398 persons in 1935 to 2145 in 1994). Establishing large animal farms during the years of communism, combined with the so-called “remediation” of the valleys leading to changes in water, soil erosion and destruction of plants, imposed a serious threat to the environment. It contributed to the destruction of both monuments of nature and history.</p>
        <p>In order to protect the cultural heritage of the ancient inhabitants of the San Valley, the Local Council of Lutowiska, using the powers assigned to the local governments under the Nature Conservation Act in 2000, created seven nature and landscapes zones on the territories of the former villages. The project was completed thanks to the funds granted&nbsp; by the Foundation of Eastern Carpathian Biodiversity Conservation established in Switzerland to promote joint activities in the International Biosphere Reserve. The project was awarded the title by the Foundation for the Development of the Carpathian Euroregion of the best from the Polish part of the Euroregion within the framework of the Local Government Innovative Practices.</p>
        <p>For many centuries the Bieszczady mountains were inhabited by various different nations, amongst which the most significant are the Rusyns, Jews and Poles. The dramatic events of the 20<sup>th</sup> century – World War II and later deportations, concluded with the “Vistula” operation, irrevocably changed this part of the country. The expulsion of the indigenous people, which went hand in hand with the elimination of culture, so carefully built over many generations, has forced Bieszczady to create their own cultural identity all over again throughout the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century until now. Fortunately, somehow Bieszczady managed to retain a lot of material and intangible heritage of our ancestors, on which new ethos can be built. The uniqueness and colour of what remains make us remember this heritage, nurture it and expose it to the world.</p>
    
 <h2 class="date">The Jewish Community from its beginnings until the Second World War</h2>
    
    <p class="quote">Jews most likely first began to settle in Lutowiska in the mid-18th century. In 1787 the town was home to 387 residents, of whom 86 were Jews who belonged to the Lesko kehilla. By 1799, 137 Jews lived in Lutowiska, and by 1824 the town was inhabited by 381 Jews. In 1835, 970 Jews lived within the large Roman Catholic parish of Polana that included Lutowiska.</p>
    <p>In the first half of the 19th century, the town had two market squares, one of which was called the “Jewish market.” The town was home to a wooden synagogue (burned to the ground by the Nazis in the summer of 1942). A second brick synagogue was located close nearby. It was built on a rectangular plan of 17.3 x 13.8 m and covered with a hip roof.</p>
    <p>In the 19th century, local trade was dominated by Jews. In 1870 the Jewish kehilla had 1,247 members. It possessed two synagogues, maintained two rabbis (one was Naftali Moriles), and operated a religious school with 50 students. In 1881, 1,309 of the town’s 1,849 inhabitants were Jewish. In 1885 the local Jewish community set up a Payment Society whose chairman was Leib Rand. In 1893 a foundation of Szymon Szlajner that paid dowries for poor Jewish girls was begun in the Lutowiska kehilla. Samuel Rand, the wealthiest Jew in the town, purchased the local manor and farm at the end of the 19th century. He also owned a few farms in the nearby villages of Chmiel, Tarnawa Wyżna, and Żurawina.</p>
    <p>In 1900 the kehilla had 2,804 members, and the town itself was inhabited by 1,570 Jewish residents. The Jewish community board maintained two religious schools, but it did not provide for the rabbi at that time. In 1902 Pinkas Melech Beer became rabbi and held this post for the next eight years. At the end of the 19th century, Jews owned three hostels, two canteens, two wine shops, and three soup kitchens in Lutowiska. Among the Jewish population were five tailors, two bookbinders, four bakers, butchers, and even a watchmaker. Lutowiska was the hometown of the well-known Izydor Penner, a volunteer in the Polish Army, a participant in the Polish-Bolshevik War, and later a doctor in Lwów.</p>
    <p>During World War I, the Jewish population in Lutowiska sharply decreased– before the outbreak of the war the town was inhabited by about 1,800 Jews, a population that decreased to 1,242 by 1921, 57.4% of the total population. Despite the decrease, Lutowiska remained the largest Jewish settlement in its Bieszczady Mountain region until World War II. Beginning in 1930, Mani Ajzenhandler was the town’s rabbi and Mendel Eisenhänder was the kehilla chairman. In 1934 the number of Jewish residents had increased again to 1,529 people. The majority of them were Hasidim, but Zionists were quickly gaining political prominence in the town. Organizations active in the town included a Farm Club of the Jewish Agricultural Society and the Society of Jewish Craftsmen Jad Charuzim. The last rabbi of Lutowiska was Jerachimel Rathaus.</p>
    
 <h2 class="date">The Second World War</h2>
    <p class="quote">In the years 1939–1941, Lutowiska was in the Soviet occupation zone. The town was seized on 27 September 1939 by the Soviets, who immediately nationalized all industry and banned all political parties and social organizations. It can be safely assumed that at that time some Jews were transported further into the Soviet empire. The Germans took over Lutowiska on 22 June 1941. Around that time 1,420 Jews lived in the town. Aron Rand was elected president of the town’s Judenrat (Jewish council established by the Nazi administration).</p>
    <p>On 22 June 1942, two Gestapo men from Ustrzyki Dolne, Johan Bäcker and Arnold Doppke, together with a military policeman named Pfejfer, shot to death approximately 650 Jews of Lutowiska with the help of the Ukrainian Police (whose commander was named Hrycak and his deputy Kilkus). Earlier in the day all the town’s Jews were gathered in the market square and sorted. Those chosen to be shot to death were confined in the court premises and in a presbytery barn. Four Gypsy families were included among them. The execution was conducted near the church and lasted from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. Only 17-year-old Blima Meyer, who had been buried alive in the mass grave, survived the massacre. According to <em>The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust</em>, there were 800 Jews in Lutowiska prior to the massacre. Presumably, the missing 150 Jews were transported to the Nazi German extermination camp in Zasław, where they were killed.</p>
    <p>Lutowiska was a predominantly wooden city. Jewish houses close to the market were burned down, as were both synagogues.  Of the larger brick synagogue likely built at the turn of the 20th, only a fragment of concrete walls designating its outline (13x11 m) has been preserved. At the end of World War II, the walls were used as a point of military resistance, as evidenced by chiseled embrasures. Of the old buildings, only the former school, a pharmacy, a house with a notable spire, and the church survived.</p>
    <p>When the plans of the Nazi’s Final Solution became known, approximately 60 Jews took shelter in huts in higher parts of the mountains under the Bukowe Berdo range. Betrayed by local Boykos, all of them died in a raid organized by the Nazis. They were buried in the place where they had been murdered. Their mass grave remains unmarked. Among those who survived the extermination was the afore-mentioned Lejb Rand along with his wife and some of the Jews who had been earlier transported to Siberia by the Soviet authorities.</p>
